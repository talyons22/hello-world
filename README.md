# hello-world
first repository-test to learn this system

I'm taking these notes for the GitHub introductory guide; I'm new to the site and just learning about it. I've been spending the past 6+ weeks learning javascript basics through Hack Reactor's free prep course, which I'm just wrapping up; I'm going to make my first attempt at their interview this coming saturday. Anyway's, I'm checking out this guide since it's being introduced at the end of the second Module in the HR prep material - I figured I should start to get familiar with GItHub as I'll need to get used to it sooner or later.

This is the first time I've looked at GitHub; the first file I've created, the first branch I've made, and the first Commit I've made.

Cheers!
Tom
